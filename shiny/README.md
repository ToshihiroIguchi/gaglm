## gaglm
Automatic selection of explanatory variable of multiple regression analysis by genetic algorithm.

### Description
It is generally difficult to select explanatory variables in multiple regression analysis. This package automatically selects explanatory variables of multiple regression analysis with genetic algorithm and it will be useful for creating your statistical model.

### Launch web application
First, access [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), download R and install.
You can install from R console.
If shiny and genalg are not installed on your PC, install shiny and glmnet with Internet connection.

    install.packages(c("shiny", "genalg"))

If shiny and glmnet are installed, it can be started from R console with the following command.
    
    shiny::runGitHub("gaglm", "ToshihiroIguchi", subdir = "shiny/")

### Host
Host the Shiny application from GitHub in a private network.
Enter the following command in R console.

    #Port specification
    port <- 1492

    #Acquire private address information
    ipconfig.dat <- system("ipconfig", intern = TRUE)
    ipv4.dat <- ipconfig.dat[grep("IPv4", ipconfig.dat)][1]
    ip <- gsub(".*? ([[:digit:]])", "\\1", ipv4.dat)

    #Host the Shiny application from GitHub
    shiny::runGitHub("gaglm", "ToshihiroIguchi", subdir = "shiny/", launch.browser = FALSE, port = port, host = ip)

If you are in the private network, you can also launch the Shiny application by entering the URL following `Listing on` to a browser.
